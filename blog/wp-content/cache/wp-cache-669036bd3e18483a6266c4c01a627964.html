<p>So many trends, so much to wear and so much to catch up on! Threadcrafts, has made it easier with a list of ‘must-follow’ trends for spring/summer 2015!</p>
<h3>1 Bohemian Paradise</h3>
<p>The <strong>bohemian trend</strong> has a care-free and romantic aura. Flowy, dreamy, soft silhouettes, pretty prints and small detailing, is what you’re going to witness this summer.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5912 size-full" src="http://d2qcji5m4lddbk.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_0904-2.jpg" alt="spring-summer-trends-2015" width="2509" height="1673" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2 Tassel drama</h3>
<p>Tassels are known for adding movement and richness from simple fabrics to laid-back outfits. This time seen with a lot of new interpretations and design modifications!</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5913 size-full" src="http://d2qcji5m4lddbk.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_0563.jpg" alt="IMG_0563" width="1707" height="2560" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3 Head to Toe White</h3>
<p>White is almost an all season colour. Seen in a lot of crisp pants and suits it is making a <strong>strong and stark appearance </strong>and giving a whole new meaning to the tone.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5914 size-full" src="http://d2qcji5m4lddbk.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1288.jpg" alt="IMG_1288" width="1707" height="2560" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4 Navy is the new black</h3>
<p>This is a <strong>wardrobe investment</strong>, its neutral and the midnight blues make a good evening ensemble. Also, it’s high time we replaced the boring blacks and tried another shade.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5915 size-full" src="http://d2qcji5m4lddbk.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/44.jpg" alt="4" width="1707" height="2560" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>‘Bow ties are for men only’, so said an archaic designer. The truth is, bow ties are back with a bang but it is not just men who love it, but women are embracing the trend too!<br />
Let’s make a round of applause for another new accessory on our list. But a word of caution here: Bow ties are an extremely tricky style statement. You wear it wrong and you may look like a deranged inmate. But we have all the right tips and tricks for you to make the bow tie fashion rock. Read on to know more:</p>
<h3>1. PICK YOUR FABRIC RIGHT</h3>
<p>Like we said, wrong styling, and poof-you killed your vibe. Bow ties don’t necessarily have to be all shiny. What matters is the fact that it should be comfortable and shouldn’t be like an itchy contraption under your chin.</p>
<p>Select a bow tie from a good and reputed company. See to it that textural fabrics are used. Suiting wools and flannel are two common materials for bow ties. Come spring and summer, you even have the choice to go for a cotton one.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-30682" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Womens-Bow-Tie.png" alt="Women's Bow Tie" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<h3>2. STICK TO THE BASICS</h3>
<p>Bow tie is formal. If you really have to make it standout, stick to the basics. Stick to black when it comes to formalwear. Keep it slim and simple for a more fashionable vibe.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-30677" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bow-Tie-For-Women.jpg" alt="Bow Tie For Women" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<h3>3. KNOW THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BOWS AVAILABLE</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Pre-Tied one: This one is like a strap on and a no brainer. You simply have to fasten it to your collar. Most of them have a clip on mechanism, but this too may vary.</li>
<li>The Self Tied one: If you want to conquer this fashion, you will have to know how to tie one. The conventional bow tie is the one which will have to be self-tied. If you don’t know how to tie one, make sure you ask your man or you could simply learn it from YouTube! (Here you have a pointy one, an hourglass one and a batwing one)</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-30679" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bow-Ties-are-Women-New-Trend.png" alt="Bow Ties are Women New Trend" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<h3>4. TIE’EM UP:</h3>
<p>Your bow ties are not supposed to be all perfect and tight. If you are wearing a clip on, of course they would look on point, but if you are settling down for a self-tied one, they may come out a little sloppy. But that’s the point! The bow ties are not supposed to look perfect! They need to look real!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-30678" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bow-ties-are-for-Women.png" alt="Bow ties are for Women" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<h3>5. WEAR IT WITH WHATEVER:</h3>
<p>Yes, you read it right. If you are not planning a formal affair, then the bow tie can be worn with anything and everything. Just don leather jacket or fashion it with a structured dress. Bow ties may be a little on the formal side, but you can always mix and match with different items to make your bow tie pop. Dresses can be your best bet but tailored suits and pencil skirts can also look great with a bow tie.</p>

<h3>6. LET THE BOW TIE DO THE TALKING:</h3>
<p>Now that you have decided to embrace the love for bow ties, make sure you let the bow tie steal the show. Make sure you wear something which will keep you bow tie in focus rather than your entire ensemble. So opt for something mute so that your ensemble is all about the bow tie and of course about you!</p>

<p>So, there you go! You have all the style tricks and tips to look dapper with your bow tie on!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Summer is a great time to explore your fashion choices and try out fresh styles. Every woman must give her wardrobe a summer overhaul, stashing all the autumn/winter wear in storage and getting ready to fill up the wardrobe with breezy summer trends. Let this article guide you on what items you must have in your wardrobe this summer.</p>
<h3>GLADIATOR SANDALS</h3>
<p>If you don’t already have gladiator sandals, I suggest you to go get a pair. Gladiator sandals are a summertime favourite. They go so well with summer dresses and give your outfit an instant glam look. Invest in a pair that rises up till your knees for a jaw dropping look and pair it with your shorts or summer dresses to look fabulous!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-28928" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Gladiator-Sandals-For-Summer-Fashion.jpg" alt="Gladiator Sandals For Summer Fashion" width="750" height="490" /></p>

<h3>SUN HAT</h3>
<p>A sun hat is a sure fire way to look super cool this summer. It is one of those items that has both fashion and practical value; it protects one’s complexion while making the person look très chic as well. Opt for a smart little hat with a normal brim or go for an outrageously wide-brimmed hat to make a statement.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-28931" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/stylish-sun-hat-for-women.png" alt="stylish sun hat for women" width="750" height="370" /></p>
<h3>FRINGED LEATHER BAG</h3>
<p>Now say goodbye to those expensive handbags, and say hello to leather. Bring out the boho-chick in you with a leather fringe bag this summer. It goes with pretty much everything, from dresses and skirts to shorts and jeans. Get one in a nice brown colour and rock the bohemian look.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-28927" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fringed-Leather-Bag-in-Summer-Fashion.png" alt="Fringed Leather Bag in Summer Fashion" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<h3>BUSTIER CROP TOP</h3>
<p>Show off your figure in a bustier crop top. You can pair it with shorts, skirts or even palazzo pants for a look that screams summer fashion. Get one in a neutral colour (white or black) that you can mix and match with your clothes. A bustier crop top is one of the top items in our must-have summer items list.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-28926" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Bustier-Crop-Top-for-summer.png" alt="Bustier Crop Top for summer" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<h3>QUIRKY SUNGLASSES</h3>
<p>Stop playing it safe and go get yourself a pair of fun and quirky sunglasses. Not only will they up your coolness quotient, they will also look awesome in pictures. The quirkier they are, the better! That means bold colours, whacky shapes and what not. Let loose and go bonkers!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-28930" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/quirky-sunglasses-better-for-summer.jpg" alt="quirky sunglasses better for summer" width="750" height="470" /></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-28936" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/zooey-heart-sunglasses.png" alt="zooey heart sunglasses" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<h3>HIGH-WAIST SHORTS</h3>
<p>You need to get your hands on a pair of high-waist shorts ASAP. They are the hottest thing this summer. Giving off a very vintage-inspired contemporary vibe, high-waist shorts have the power to make you look like a total diva. Make high-waist shorts your new best friend this summer, so be sure to get a couple of pairs in denim and cotton.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-28929" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/High-Waist-Shorts-are-hottest-thing-this-summer.png" alt="High-Waist Shorts  are hottest thing this summer" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<h3>SUMMER DRESS</h3>
<p>We recently posted an article on must-have summer dresses. You cannot go through summer without wearing a lot of summer dresses. These are breezy dresses, preferably in cotton, that allow of easy movement and are super comfortable to wear. They help you to put up with the scorching heat of the summer sun, while ensuring that you look pretty as the picture. So make sure you have a couple of summer dresses in your wardrobe to help sail you through the demanding summer.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-28932" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Summer-Dress.png" alt="Summer Dress" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<p>Summer is a great time to show skin and not have to worry about layering your clothing. Apart from the hassle of having to slather on sunscreen every few hours, summer is a time for a lot of outdoor activities. Are summer must-haves act as the perfect solution to beating the heat while managing to look stylish and trendy at the same time. Make sure you have all the mentioned items in your wardrobe to ensure that you make the most of your summer in terms of fashion and style.</p>

<p>Movies never fail to inspire us. Whether it’s Salman’s iconic hairstyle from ‘Tere Naam’ or Preity Zinta’s nerdy glasses from ‘Kal Ho Na Ho’, we always mirror our celebrities in some way or the other. For us women, the best way to copy celebs is to wear attires similar to them! Let’s read how to get your Salwar stitched-Bollywood Ishtyle! Having said that, please keep in mind which salwars would suit your body type.</p>
<h3>Old School Style: Sadhna’s Churidar Kurtas</h3>
<p>This is one of the most iconic looks of the yesteryears. Sadhana’s style was copied by eager female fans all over the country. Her tight-fitting kurtas became popular all around. The good thing is; this style is still very much in vogue. You would thus see a lot of women flaunting this style time and again. Vintage and old school styles are coming around in a big way and it is not too late to have your Sadhana suit stitched. Make sure you take the correct fittings before getting it stitched because these are tight fitting and will not look good if the fitting is off.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-29285" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Salwar-Suit-Bollywood-Ishtyle.png" alt="Salwar Suit -Bollywood Ishtyle" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Colour Splash: Babli’s ensemble</h3>
<p>You can’t ignore Bunty and Babli. Especially because Babli has such a colourful ensemble going on! Rani Mukherjee played Babli’s role with élan and managed to look great even in a riot of colours. Combing Kurtis and Patialas with some of the brightest colours, she managed to look great even when she was running from the cops! To get your suit stitched like this, make sure you ask your tailor for very contrasting colours and beautiful Indian embroidery and designs.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-29284" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Rani-Mukherjee-in-Bunti-Aur-Babli.png" alt="Rani Mukherjee in Bunti Aur Babli" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<h3>Gorgeous Avatar: Piggy Chops Style</h3>
<p>Priyanka Chopra has always been the kind of fashion icon everyone looks up to. Whether she is rocking her look in leather pants or in salwars, she has always looked good. Priyanka usually carries off anarkalis very well. One of the best looks she has donned is for a fashion line called ‘Heroine’. Her salwars are regal and intricately designed.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-29283" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Priyanka-Chopra-in-Salwar-Suit.png" alt="Priyanka Chopra in Salwar Suit" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Fun and Flirty: Kareena’s Jab We Met Avatar</h3>
<p>It was Geet from Jab We Met who propelled Kareena to stardom. Fun, flirty and fresh, Geet’s look was all about colours! Geet’s colourful and embroidered salwars and patialas are still a rage. Though most of her ensembles were designed by Manish Malhotra, you can still take cues from her look and get gold, embroidery and sequins work out for a colourful suit.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-29281" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kareena-Kapoor-Salwar-Avatar-in-Jab-We-Met.png" alt="Kareena Kapoor Salwar Avatar in Jab We Met" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<div class="media-main-wrapper"></div>
<h3>Colour Blocking Boss: Anushka Rules</h3>
<p>Anushka Sharma’s clothes in Band Baaja Baraat are perfect examples of colour blocking. This style is still in vogue and brightly-coloured salwars are all over town. If you want to have some colour blocked salwars in your closet, make sure you take a cue from Anushka. Most of her ensembles have two very contrasting colours. The good thing about her any of her salwars is that they would have some or the other detail of one of the colours. You can also ask your tailor to add some gold hues for a more festive look.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-29278" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Anushka-Sharma-in-band-baaja-baaraat..png" alt="Anushka Sharma in band baaja baaraat." width="750" height="490" /></p>
<h3>Anarkalis galore: Pareeniti Chopra in a regal look</h3>
<p>Anarkalis are back with a bang. While most of us believe that Anarkalis are mostly meant for weddings, Parineeti’s look debunked this. Her look in Dawaat-E-Ishq brought Anarkalis in a new light. If you want Anarkalis which you would love to wear in event other than weddings, then you should surely get your anarkalis stitched in Gullu’s style. Keep in mind that you can design them in bold colours and add hues of gold to make your salwars look glam.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-29282" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Parineeti-Chopra-Daawat-e-Ishq.jpg" alt="Parineeti Chopra Daawat-e-Ishq" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<p>So there you go! You have a wide range of flattering Salwar Kameez Neck Designs as well to choose from. We have given you some great ideas to get your Salwar stitched Bollywood style.</p>

<p>Girls want to have all the fun. And they know how to get their way out too, whether it is at home, work or gossip. Take a look at fashion corridors where women have grabbed the news by adopting dhoti pants as attire. It is no longer a male domain but an upcoming fashion twist that girls are happily wearing and flaunting. Remember Bollywood star Rani Mukherji who created a fashion rage by wearing dhoti pants in the film <em>Bunty aur Babli</em>.</p>
<p>Dhoti pants have come of age ever since the trend stepped in. Today, one gets to see a range of vibrant colours, exotic prints and innovative fabrics in dhoti pant. It’s an Indian garment that lets you be your creative self. There is a lot of casual and colourful look to it which is easy carrying to work as much as it is doing errand jobs in the house.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-29180" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Dhoti-Pants.jpg" alt="Dhoti Pants for this Summer" width="749" height="496" /></p>
<h3>Pant Patterns</h3>
<p>Summers are at their blistering high. With dhoti pants, you can create a new wardrobe definition and fan following. Pastel colours are haute as much as solid colours such as blue, green, pink and red. Floral and paisley prints give a quirky and hippie look. As for availability, check out the lanes and bylanes of Janpath in Delhi, Dilli Haat in INA Market or the happening Sarojini Nagar market, as these are some of the <a title="Best Shopping Places in Delhi" href="http://www.fashionlady.in/best-shopping-places-in-delhi-the-famous-five-haunts-for-fashionistas-unveiled/26887" target="_blank">best shopping places in Delhi</a>, for some artsy and ethnic prints in dhoti pants. However, if you are a travel bug, go to tourist places such as Puducherry and Mahabalipuram where these pants are not only dirt cheap, most of the firang tourists are found wearing them due to their comfort quotient.</p>

<h3>Fashion Comparison</h3>
<p>What is so unique about the dhoti pant? The fabric of these low-rise pants has several pleats that create an interesting width at the top (that is around the thigh area). For simplicity purpose, they are essentially loose at the upper leg area and start tapering down to the ankle making it attention-grabbing. This could be one of the reasons why dhoti pant has become the hottie in college girls as much as on the glam runway.</p>
<p>How different are harem pants from dhoti pants? Harem pants are found loose throughout the leg that is the thigh area but not so at the hemline. Dhoti pants have more of gathered fabric than harem pants.</p>
<p>And why forget the jeans? The skin hugging fabric that has been there around for many years sometimes poses a bit of a problem for girls as they tend to get ‘restrictive’ not free flowing. It is the airy feel that girls look forward to and adopt more easily given the cruel Indian summers.</p>

<p>Saree is undoubtedly the most sensual Indian attire, and we all know how to wear it the formal way. But do you know how to look the utmost fashionable by adding some interesting twists to your saree-draping style? Yes, there are several different styles of wearing the sari.</p>
<h3>Here is a complete style guide for you:</h3>
<h3>1. Traditional Indian / Nivi Saree Style</h3>
<p>‘Nivi’ is the classic saree draping style of India, and most of us swear by it. Originated from Andhra Pradesh, this simple style has now been accepted by women throughout the country. It is the versatility of the style, which makes it a universal choice. All you need is a fashionable saree, a perfectly-fit blouse and complementing accessories to go ‘Nivi’, and stun others.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-30213" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Traditional-Indian-Nivi-Saree-Style.png" alt="Traditional Indian  Nivi Saree Style" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ejKmf7uuIaQ?feature=oembed" width="620" height="349" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>2. Bengali Saree Style</h3>
<p>Remember Vidya Balan’s true Bengali look in ‘Parineeta’? Though the way she draped the saree seems to be a tad bit difficult, it is actually quite easy. In the typical Bengali style, the saree is worn wrapping the pallu around the body twice with two wide pleats at the front. Cotton, handloom and brocade sarees go really well with this unique and elegant look.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-30203 aligncenter" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bengali-Saree-Style.png" alt="Bengali Saree Style" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w6QGNx5o0Iw?feature=oembed" width="620" height="349" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>3. Gujarati Saree Style</h3>
<p>Gujarati style has now become the most popular regional saree-draping style in India, thanks to the daily soaps! It is mostly similar to the Nivi style, but the pallu section is arranged in a completely different manner. Instead of placing the pallu on the left shoulder, it is brought towards the front over the right shoulder. It is then either left hanging or tucked in at the back partially. A stylish saree with heavily embellished pallu is what you need, to sport this look.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-30205 aligncenter" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Gujarati-Saree-Style.png" alt="Gujarati Saree Style" width="750" height="490" /></p>

<h3>4. Kerala Saree Style</h3>
<p>A saree, when worn in the typical Kerala style or Mundu Neriyathum way, can make you look absolutely pure and sophisticated. The classic attire comprises of two sections i.e. ‘Neriyathum’ ( the upper one draped over the blouse) and ‘Mundu’ (the lower one draped around the body and tucked behind). You can go for a classy white saree with a broad zari or golden border and try out this style.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuIVYCsKw78?feature=oembed" width="620" height="349" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>5. Maharashtrian Saree Style</h3>
<p>Ever wondered how Maharashtrian women manage to drape that 9-yard long (yes! it is not the regular 6) fabric in such a neat, compact and super stylish way? To add to your surprise, the entire saree is tucked in on itself and you can wear it simply on your favorite pair of shorts or Capri rather than a petticoat. And don’t forget the signature nose ring, those colorful bangles and fresh jasmine flowers.</p>

<h3>6. Lehenga Saree Style</h3>
<p>Confused what to choose for your bestie’s D-day party? Drape your favorite saree in Lehenga style and get ready to be the head-turner at the event. Although pre-stitched lehenga sarees are easily available in the market now, you can do it yourself too. Just make multiple pleats with the pallu and tuck them around the waist. Oh, did we tell you that it suits curvy women the best?</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BknYu7TWqjk?feature=oembed" width="620" height="349" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>7. Butterfly Saree Style</h3>
<p>This is the latest style of wearing saree. Styling like our Bollywood divas becomes really easy once you master the butterfly saree draping technique. It is nothing but a sweet and sexy twist to the basic Nivi style in which the pallu is pleated extremely thin for a mysterious navel-show. This style is considered as the most fashionable choice for a party and you can avail a pre-pleated as well as pre-stitched saree for this purpose. Otherwise, simply drape a lightweight saree in the butterfly way and team it up with a statement blouse.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-30204 aligncenter" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Butterfly-Saree-Style.png" alt="Butterfly Saree Style" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GsZ2Y-iCNb8?feature=oembed" width="620" height="349" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>8. Mumtaz Saree Style</h3>
<p>Mumtaz, the 80s’ legendary heroine, draped her saree this way in the superhit song ‘Aaj kal tere mere pyar ke charche’ and since then, it has become a wonderful style itself. You can get this sensuous retro look by wrapping the saree multiple times around the lower part of your body tightly. The most exclusive thing about this saree-draping style is that it flaunts the figure the most flattering way.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-30211 aligncenter" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mumtaz-Saree-Style.png" alt="Mumtaz Saree Style" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UMGkjQgJpc8?feature=oembed" width="620" height="349" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>9. Rajrani Saree Style</h3>
<p>The name of the style itself reflects a royal elegance, isn’t it? Well, Rajrani is the classiest variation of the Gujarati style saree-draping and you can try it on some of the best occasions. Start with wearing the saree the regular Gujarati way with front pleated pallu and then create a ‘V’-shape with it. Rich and highly adorned silk or net sarees are perfect for this style.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-30212 aligncenter" src="http://www.fashionlady.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Rajrani-Saree-Style.png" alt="Rajrani Saree Style" width="750" height="490" /></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6bjrXu7j7A0?feature=oembed" width="620" height="349" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>10. Mermaid Saree Style</h3>
<p>No matter whether the mermaid stories are true or not, you can create a mermaid-look by draping your saree the right way. If you have a curvaceous figure, you are definitely going to rock it. But don’t worry as this style goes well with almost all types of body. Mermaid style involves draping the saree with no pleats at the waist. Moreover, it gives a flared skirt-like look at the lower end, which makes one look slimmer and sexier. So, go for an attractive saree with bedecked border and pallu.</p>
